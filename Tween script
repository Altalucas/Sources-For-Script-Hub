local TweenService = game:GetService("TweenService")
function Tween(part,speed)
    local new = part
    local char = game:GetService("Players").LocalPlayer.Character
    local ply = char.HumanoidRootPart
    local ti = TweenInfo.new(speed, Enum.EasingStyle.Linear)
    local tp = {CFrame = new}
    local tween = TweenService:Create(ply, ti, tp)
    tween:play()
end
Tween(Part.CFrame, 1)

Part is any instance with Cframe
1 is amount of time (seconds) to tween from current position to Part 
If you have more than 5 iq you can remake it to work with positions and cframes at the same time
